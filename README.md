## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Artur Miralles**, a PhD student passionate about applying AI in biomedical sciences. My current research focuses on **Multimodal Machine Learning** to help stratify people with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis. I aim to uncover patterns that could improve our understanding of this complex condition.

### What I'm Learning ðŸ§ 
I'm currently learning about **cross-modal machine learning techniques** and **probabilistic models**, exploring how they can be applied to health data.

### What I'm Working On ðŸ”¬
- Building machine learning models to integrate and analyse complex biomedical datasets.
- Contributing to projects aimed at uncovering genetic variants associated with specific ME/CFS symptoms.

### My Hobbies ðŸŽ®
When Iâ€™m not coding or reading papers, I enjoy playing both **board games** and **video games**, going for **walks** and **reading** books.
